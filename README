= HAML (XHTML Abstraction Markup Language)

HAML is a markup language that is used to cleanly and simply describe the XHTML 
of any web document without the use of inline code. HAML functions as a 
replacement for inline page templating systems such PHP, RHTML, and ASP. 
However, HAML avoids the need for explicitly coding XHTML into the template, 
because it iself is a description of the XHTML, with some code to generate 
dynamic content.

== Features

* Whitespace Active
* Well-formatted XHTML
* DRY
* Follows styles common in CSS

== Using HAML as a Rails plugin

Write Rails templates with the .haml extension. Example:

  %html
    %head
      %title= "Teen Wolf (1985)"
    %body
      #contents
        %h1 "A highschooler discovers that he is a werewolf"
        %ul.cast
          %li "Scott Howard"
          %li "Rupert 'Stiles' Stilinski"
          %li "Lisa 'Boof' Marconi"
          %li "Lewis"

Would result in this XHTML:

  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Teen Wolf (1985)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="contents">
        <h1>A highschooler discovers that he is a werewolf</h1>
        <ul class="cast">
          <li>Scott Howard</li>
          <li>Rupert 'Stiles' Stilinski</li>
          <li>Lisa 'Boof' Marconi</li>
          <li>Lewis</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>

You can access instance variables in HAML templates the same way you do in ERb templates.

  file: app/controllers/movies_controller.rb

  class MoviesController < ApplicationController
    def index
      @title = "Teen Wolf"
    end
  end

  file: app/views/movies/index.haml

  #content
   .title
     %h1= @title
 
Would produce the following HTML:

  <div id="content">
    <div class="title">
      <h1>Teen Wolf</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
