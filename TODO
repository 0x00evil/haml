Testing:
  Test html2haml
  Test Sassy import

Documentation:
  Haml::Engine public method documentation could use work
  Sass::Engine load_paths option needs documenting.

Features:
  Sass should throw generic errors for undefined constants, not syntax errors
  Sass::Plugin should log errors
  There should be a way to represent options in-document
  Haml and Sass executables should return meaningful exit codes
  There should be a way to make Haml tags not insert whitespace
  "%li, %a"?
  Sass::Engine load_paths option should be set by executable
  Errors in imported files should point to the proper files.
  meta, br, etc. tags should be automatically self-closed.
