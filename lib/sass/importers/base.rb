  module Importers
    # The abstract base class for Sass importers.
    # All importers should inherit from this.
    #
    # At the most basic level, an importer is given a string
    # and must return a {Sass::Engine} containing some Sass code.
    # This string can be interpreted however the importer wants;
    # however, subclasses are encouraged to use the URI format
    # for pathnames.
    #
    # Importers that have some notion of "relative imports"
    # should take a single load path in their constructor,
    # and interpret paths as relative to that.
    # They should also implement the \{#find\_relative} method.
    #
    # Importers should be serializable via `Marshal.dump`.
    # In addition to the standard `_dump` and `_load` methods,
    # importers can define `_before_dump`, `_after_dump`, `_around_dump`,
    # and `_after_load` methods as per {Haml::Util#dump} and {Haml::Util#load}.
    #
    # @abstract
    class Base

      # Find a Sass file relative to another file.
      # Importers without a notion of "relative paths"
      # should just return nil here.
      #
      # If the importer does have a notion of "relative paths",
      # it should ignore its load path during this method.
      #
      # See \{#find} for important information on how this method should behave.
      #
      # @param uri [String] The URI to import. This is not necessarily relative,
      #   but this method should only return true if it is.
      # @param base [String] The base filename. If `uri` is relative,
      #   it should be interpreted as relative to `base`.
      #   `base` is guaranteed to be in a format importable by this importer.
      # @param options [{Symbol => String}] Options for the Sass file
      #   containing the `@import` that's currently being resolved.
      # @return [Sass::Engine, nil] An Engine containing the imported file,
      #   or nil if it couldn't be found or was in the wrong format.

      # Find a Sass file, if it exists.
      #
      # This is the primary entry point of the Importer.
      # It corresponds directly to an `@import` statement in Sass.
      # It should do three basic things:
      #
      # * Determine if the URI is in this importer's format.
      #   If not, return nil.
      # * Determine if the file indicated by the URI actually exists and is readable.
      #   If not, return nil.
      # * Read the file and place the contents in a {Sass::Engine}.
      #   Return that engine.
      #
      # If this importer's format allows for file extensions,
      # it should treat them the same way as the default {Filesystem} importer.
      # If the URI explicitly has a `.sass` or `.scss` filename,
      # the importer should look for that exact file
      # and import it as the syntax indicated.
      # If it doesn't exist, the importer should return nil.
      #
      # If the URI doesn't have either of these extensions,
      # the importer should look for files with the extensions.
      # If no such files exist, it should return nil.
      #
      # The {Sass::Engine} to be returned should be passed `options`,
      # with a few modifications. `:filename` and `:syntax` should be set appropriately,
      # and `:importer` should be set to this importer.
      #
      # @param uri [String] The URI to import.
      # @param options [{Symbol => String}] Options for the Sass file
      #   containing the `@import` that's currently being resolved.
      #   This is safe for subclasses to modify destructively.
      #   Callers should only pass in a value they don't mind being destructively modified.
      # @return [Sass::Engine, nil] An Engine containing the imported file,
      #   or nil if it couldn't be found or was in the wrong format.
      def find(uri, options)
        raise "Implement Me"

      # Should be overridden by subclasses.
      #
      # This is used to help debugging,
      # and should usually just show the load path encapsulated by this importer.
